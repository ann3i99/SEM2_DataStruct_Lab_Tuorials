My name is Anneisha with matrix number, U2005324. I am
majoring in Multimedia Computing. This is my first time taking the
Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling anxious about taking this
subject. This is because my programming skills are not the best.
I acquired B for my previous Programming 1 course. Itâ€™s not too bad. So, I
think I can manage to get at least a B for this DS subject this term. In order
to do well in the subject, I will work hard. Wish me luck!!!
